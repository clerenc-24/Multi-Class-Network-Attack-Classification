# Multi-Class-Network-Attack-Classification
Modern networks generate high-dimensional traffic data that can be used to detect intrusions and cyber-attacks. In this project, we use the MachineLearningCVE dataset (MachineLearningCSV.zip) - a labeled network-traffic dataset containing both benign traffic and multiple attack types.
